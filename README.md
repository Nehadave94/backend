# eCommerce Application

This is a full-stack eCommerce application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **Redux** for state management. The app includes essential eCommerce features such as product browsing, cart functionality, user authentication, payment integration, and more. Below is an overview of the key aspects of the project.

## Features

- **User Management**: Sign up, log in, update profiles, and view order history.
- **Product Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete products, including managing categories, images, prices, and stock.
- **Shopping Cart**: Browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders, including storing shipping details and payment status.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with Stripe or PayPal.
- **Product Search & Filter**: Users can search and filter products based on categories, prices, and more.

## Tech Stack

### Front-End

- **React**: Used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux**: Manages the global application state, including the shopping cart, product filters, and user authentication.
- **Redux Thunk**: Middleware for handling asynchronous actions, such as API calls.
- **CSS Flexbox/Grid & Bootstrap**: Ensures the site is responsive across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- **Axios**: For making API requests from the front-end to the back-end.

### Back-End

- **Node.js**: Executes JavaScript server-side to handle requests and process data.
- **Express.js**: A framework for building the server-side logic, including routing and API endpoints for products, orders, and user authentication.
- **RESTful APIs**: Created for:
  - User registration and login (with JWT-based authentication)
  - Fetching, creating, updating, and deleting products
  - Managing shopping carts and orders
  - Payment processing
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securing user authentication and authorization.
- **Role-based Access**: Admins can manage products and orders, while users can browse products and place orders.

### Database

- **MongoDB**: Used to store users, products, orders, and other relevant data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that interacts with MongoDB using schemas and models.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

- `MONGODB_URL`: The MongoDB connection URL.
- `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL for the front-end application.
- `MY Backend URL`: MongoDB connection URL.

Start the back-end server:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Frontend

- `REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMIN`: The URL for the back-end server, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`.
- `REACT_APP_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The admin email address for managing the application.

Start the front-end server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment

### Front-End

- The front-end can be deployed using platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

### Back-End

- The back-end can be deployed using cloud platforms like  **AWS**.

### Database

- Use **MongoDB Atlas** to host the MongoDB database in the cloud.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Encryption**: Use `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure secure communication between the client and server by using HTTPS.
- **API Security**: Secure the API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access using JWT and role-based authentication.

## Performance Optimization

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets (e.g., products, orders) to reduce server load.
- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images to ensure faster page loading times.
